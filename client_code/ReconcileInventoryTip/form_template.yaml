      content: "1). Recount the inventory.\nRescan the item using the barcode (or enter the part number) to confirm the count. Someone may have miscounted.\n\n2). Verify the part number.\nThe barcode ensures accuracy, but if a part is not barcoded or incorrectly labelled, confirm its correct identification by entering the part number manually before reconciliation.\n\n3). Look for missing transactions.\nThe system quantity may be incorrect because a transaction was not yet entered. Ensure all job cards and invoices are recorded.\n\n4). Investigate possible customer ownership.\nSome parts may belong to customers but are stored on-site. Confirm before reconciling.\n\n5). Investigate possible supplier ownership.\nThere may be supplier-owned items (on consignment or pending return) that should not be included in your stock.\n\n6). Check for mixed products.\nItems may have been stored in the wrong location or mixed with other similar parts. \n\n7). Investigate possible theft.\nStock loss due to theft must be ruled out. \n\n8). Check for system bugs.\nIf scanned quantities and recorded transactions do not tally, the system may have reporting or posting errors. Ensure thorough testing with sample data and escalate system issues promptly."
