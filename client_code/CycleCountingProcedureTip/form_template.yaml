        Before the count:
        First of all, decide on a date and time for your count.
        Next, minimize or completely do away with stock moving in and out of store, in order to avoid miscalculated figures. You can either close operations down for a day or conduct it after working hours.

      content: "1). Complete all data entry of inventory transactions so the inventory database is fully updated. A regular system update is key.\n\n2). Scan items on the shelf using the barcode scanner (or enter the part number if the barcode is missing/unreadable). The system will automatically display the part name, part number, and quantity of parts under inspection. \n\nNB: If a part exists physically but is not yet in the system, the user can add the missing part record into the database immediately so it can be included in the count.\n\n3). Investigate all differences found. The system will highlight mismatches, and these should be discussed with the store manager to determine whether there is a recurring error pattern that requires corrective action.\n\n4). Update procedures and training if required. If systemic issues are identified, update processes, staff training, or controls to reduce future discrepancies."
